# My dissertation project: CodeBot

CodeBot is a chatbot application utilized by two main types of users: computer science students and lecturers. CodeBot is hosted online http://www.doc.gold.ac.uk/usr/206/, in the homepage of the
application, the chatbot is available, which responds to student’s queries related to SQL programming language. 

In most cases the chatbot can perform language recognition and respond accordingly. It also has a rating feature and the data collected via
the rating feature is stored into the database and used to create simple statistics. Lecturers can login with CodeBot to view chatbot statistics and edit chatbot’s bank of
SQL related responses.
